# Weather-App

This is a simple weather app built with React. It uses the browser's geolocation API to get the user's current location, and then makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the current weather data for that location. The app then displays the current temperature and humidity.

The app makes use of the useState and useEffect hooks to handle the state and fetching the weather data.
